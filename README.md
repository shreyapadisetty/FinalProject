# FinalProject
My program is a library checkout system. This helps the user avoid interacting with the library staff and they can do this at home. There are parts of the program where I wanted to imitate a loading screen. I did this by sleeping the program to make the code execute slower. The program starts with welcoming the user to the program and showing them a list of items they can checkout. There are 4 categories: textbooks, calculators, cameras, and games. The user can select an item from any of these categories by inputting a number from 1-15. The program loops until the user is done selecting items they want to check out. The program ends with printing out the summary of what the user wanted to checkout along with a thank you message. I believe there is a lot I can improve with this project. Making it more similar to a library checkout system would make this project better. This would include being able to check what you have checked out, returning items, and seeing how many of each item are available.
